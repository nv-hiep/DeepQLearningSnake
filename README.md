Play Snake game using Reinforcement Learing (Deep Q-learning Network)

## Dependencies
Code is written in python 3.<br>
1. numpy
2. turtle
3. Python3.6+
4. gym

## Usage:
1. The main file is `main_qlearning.py`, Deep Q-learning algorithm

2. Game environment in `snake.py`

## To Run
- Run command:
python3 main_qlearning.py


This project contains the following files:
1. snake.py : game environment, run this and you can play the game Snake by yourself
2. main_qlearning.py : run this and a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent will learn to play snake
3. requirements.txt : you will need some Python packages, like turtle, gym, TensorFlow and Keras before you can run the scripts, install these first
