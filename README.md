Play Snake game using Reinforcement Learing (Deep Q-learning Network)

## Dependencies
Code is written in python 3.<br>
1. numpy
2. turtle
3. Python3.6+
4. gym

## Usage:
1. The main file is `qlearning_snake.py`

2. Deep Q-learning algorithm in `helper\qlearner.py`

3. Other tools in `helper\tools.py`

4. A json file (`qvalues.json`) will be generated in `data\`

## To Run
- Run command:
>>> python3 deep_qlearning_snake.py





This project contains the following files:
1. snake_env.py : run this and you can play the game Snake by yourself
2. agent_1.py : run this and a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent will learn to play snake
3. plot_script.py : plotting the results of the agent
4. requirements.txt : you will need some Python packages, like turtle, TensorFlow and Keras before you can run the scripts, install these first

Enjoy!
